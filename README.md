ModelTypeBundle
===============

This bundle can be used to replace native `EntityType` with something that is more abstract.
So, in your rich domain application, you can refer to your model class in a more abstract way.

This bundle is still a work in progress. There is no implementation for now.

TO DO
-----

* a type, named "ModelType"
* a data transformer, to transform object in id and viceversa
* options (to customize way to retrieve object, filter objects, etc.)
